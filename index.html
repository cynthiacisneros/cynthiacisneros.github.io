<h1> Cynthia Lizeth Cisneros </h1>
<h2> Bachelors of Science in Computer Applications </h2>

<P> I've worked in education since for over 10 years, and throughout this time I discovered my passion for data and problem solving. After a decade of trials and erros, I knew that data analytics or computer applications would be my career pathway. My goal for my major is to learn a variety of programming softwares and best practices for data management. 
    This includes learning SQL, Python, R, Tableau, and Excel. I also hope to learn more about data visualization and how to effectively communicate data findings. </P>
<P>In this course, I hope to learn effective tools to assist me in successfully managing and completing projects. I also hope to familiarize myself more with HTML and Github, as these are new concepts to me. Another goal for my major and course is to build a network of support through professors and fellow students who are actively working in computer applications, 
    or who have similar interests. I hope to build relationships that I will carry with me beyond my time at Texas Tech. </P> 
 <P> When I have free time, I do enjoy a few hobbies. </P>
 
    <li> I enjoy painting with watercolors. </li>
    <li> This past summer I learned to make bowls and figures with clay. </li>
    <li> I also enjoy golfing on the rare occasion that I can go. </li>
